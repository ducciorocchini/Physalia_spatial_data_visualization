# Overview
This course provides an exploration of spatial data analysis techniques in the context of ecology, with a focus on visualizing spatial amtrices and point patterns, and addressing accessibility challenges in scientific visualization. Participants will gain hands-on experience with R tools and packages for spatial analysis, focusing on practical applications in ecological studies.

# Requirements

This is a basic course devoted to spatial visualization. No specific requirements are needed. Prveious experience with R is not mandatory.  


## Packages needed
+ terra
+ imageRy
+ ggplot2
+ viridis
+ RStoolbox (for tidyverse related functions)
+ geodata (for virtual species)
+ virtualspecies
+ biscale (for bivariate maps)
+ gclus (for scatterplot matrices)
+ GGally (for scatterplot matrices)
+ gpairs (for scatterplot matrices)
+ cartogram
+ sf (for cartograms)
+ tmap (for cartograms)
+ colorist (for niche overlap)

+ spatstat (for density maps)
  
# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. **Visualize Remote Sensing Data:**  
   - Effectively use RGB plotting and ggplot2 to visualize remote sensing data with raster matrices in ecological studies.

2. **Understand Spatial Variability:**  
   - Differentiate between distance-based and abundance-based measures of spatial variability and apply them to ecological data analysis.

3. **Analyze Temporal Variability:**  
   - Use ridgeline plots to explore and visualize temporal variability in ecological datasets.

4. **Utilize Spatial Analysis Techniques:**  
   - Create and interpret scatterplots and hexagon binning plots for visualizing spatial data from remote sensing sources.

6. **Address Accessibility in Scientific Visualization:**  
   - Understand the challenges of colorblindness in scientific graphs and apply appropriate design principles for accessible visualizations using the `tidyverse`.

8. **Create Accessible Visualizations:**  
   - Design colorblind friendly visualizations and ensure accessibility in spatial data representations.
