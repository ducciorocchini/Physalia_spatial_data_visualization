# Spatial data visualization 

## Day 1: Showing sptaial distribution of species
+ Spatial distributions:
   + Species distributions: cartograms, overlap, bivariate maps
   + Spatial density maps in R
   + Scatterplot matrices 
+ Simulating spatial distribution of species in data cubes: the gcube package
+ Virtual spesies
  
## Day 2: RS data
+ Visualizing ecosystems through remote sensing data: RGB plotting and proper use of ggplot2 with raster matrices
+ Spatial Variability: distance based versus abundance based measures
+ Multivariate analysis
+ Temporal variability: Ridgeline plots
+ Scatterplots of remote sensing data and hexagon binning

## Day 3: Colorblindness
+ Problems related to scientific graphs and colorblindness 

## Day 4: Spatial data reporting
+ Markdown and LaTex: doc and presentation reporting

## Bonus sessions:
+ hexbin
